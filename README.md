# binary-interfaces

Analysing protein-protein interfaces and their folding patterns using the block-WSME model. 

The workflow folder has all the scripts and the plots. 

The generated data from the analysis of the outputs of the WSME model is stored in the analysis_output folder

The plots are in the plots folder. Four types of plots have been generated for each structure. 
1. blockwise free energy plot
2. Free energy for the whole interface 
3. Free energies of all the microstates in the minimum energy macrostate
4. Free energy for the minimum energy state macrostate (for all temperatures across all microstates, as a heatmap)

The jupyter notebook free_energy.ipynb is a sandbox notebook (can be ignored, or used for testing).
